            <h3>Victory Day</h3>
            <p>The celebration of Victory Day has been taking place since 1972. The Bangladesh Liberation War became a
                topic of great importance in cinema, literature, history lessons at school, the mass media, and the arts
                in Bangladesh. The ritual of the celebration gradually obtained a distinctive character with a number of
                similar elements: Military Parade by the Bangladesh Armed Forces at the National Parade Ground,
                ceremonial meetings, speeches, lectures, receptions and fireworks displays.[13] Victory Day in
                Bangladesh is a joyous celebration in which popular culture plays a great role. TV and radio stations
                broadcast special programs and patriotic songs.[14] The main streets are decorated with national flags.
                Different political parties and socioeconomic organizations undertake programs to mark the day in a
                befitting manner, including the paying of respects at Jatiyo Smriti Soudho, the national memorial at
                Savar in Dhaka District</p>

                    They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web developer. I made their website
                    and
                    showed
                    it to them. They liked it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming Hero.
